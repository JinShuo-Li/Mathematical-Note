## 📖 Introduction

This repository contains my personal lecture notes and study summaries on **Mathematics and Axiomatization**. The project is typeset in $\LaTeX$ and covers a rigorous restructuring of mathematical foundations, ranging from logic and set theory to advanced analysis and algebra.

The goal of this project is to build a cohesive mathematical framework starting from the most basic axioms.

## 🗂️ Table of Contents

The notes are organized into the following chapters:

* **Chapter 0: Basic Knowledge & Notations**
    * Propositional Logic
    * Predicate Logic
* **Chapter 1: The Axioms of ALL**
    * Naïve Set Theory
    * ZFC Axioms
    * Relations, Functions, and Cardinality
* **Chapter 2: Mathematical Analysis I**
    * Construction of Number Systems
    * Limits, Continuity, and Differentiation
    * Riemann Integration
* **Chapter 3: Linear Algebra**
    * Vector Spaces & Matrices
    * Spectral Theory & SVD
* **Chapter 4: Abstract Algebra**
    * Groups, Rings, and Fields
    * Galois Theory
* **More**: More content will be comming soon.

## 🛠️ Usage & Compilation

This project has been split into multiple files for faster compilation. The main entry point is `main.tex`.

### File Structure
```text
.
├── main.tex            # The primary file to compile
├── M&A.tex             # (Archive) The original single file
├── chapters/           # Folder containing individual chapters
│   ├── preface.tex
│   ├── chapter0.tex
│   ├── chapter1.tex
│   └── ...
└── README.md

```

### How to Compile

You need a standard TeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX).

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)

```


2. Compile using `latexmk` (recommended) or `pdflatex`:
```bash
latexmk -pdf main.tex

```
